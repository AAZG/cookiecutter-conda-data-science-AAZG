# Cookiecutter Conda Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

## Requirements

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) >=5.x
- [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Create a new project

In a folder where you want your project generated:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/jvelezmagic/cookiecutter-conda-data-science
```
